  <h1>About</h1>
 <p>I am a down to earth, passionate, exuberant and an aspiring web developer.
 For a large part of my career I have been working at the airport and it has acclimated
 me with a range of different backgrounds and perspective, due to this I feel that
 I have what it takes to be a teamplayer, and if there's one thing i know, it's that
 team work makes the dream work!</p></div> )
