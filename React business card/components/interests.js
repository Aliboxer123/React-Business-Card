<p><i>My interests are many, my equals are none</i> Said the great Napoleon.
All jokes aside I like to divert a lot of my free time towards productive things, 
I am restless If I don't make use of the little time we have. As the stoic philosophers
used to say; "our melancholy seems perpertual to the conscius mind until the sweet
aroma of death overtakes us".<br/>
My hobbies are; web development, reading and the study of
Geology.</p></div>)
